            <p class="description">Easy to make and fast recipe for tasty dumplings. 
                If ingredient ammounts are proportionately increased, 
                additional portions can be preserved in the freezer for later.
                Recommended to enjoy with 1 to 1 soy-sauce/vinegar mix.</p>
                    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Minced pork meat (500g)(if not avalible in your local store a pork/beef mix is viable too).</li>
                            <li>Wheat (flour 500g)</li>
                            <li>Water (1/2 cups)</li>
                            <li>Cabbage (3 bigger leaves)</li>
                            <li>Corriander 2-5g</li>
                            <li>Onion leaves (2)</li>
                            <li>Onion (1)</li>
                            <li>Salt (2-3 teaspoons)</li>
                            <li>Pepper (1/2 teaspoon, adjust by taste)</li>
                            <li>Soy sauce (1 tablespoon)</li>
                            <li>Ginger (1 tablespoon)</li>
                        </ul>
                    <div><h3>Preperation:</h3>
                        <h4>Dough:</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Boil the water in a kettle or a pot.</li>
                            <li>Prepare the flour in a bowl and pour over the boiling hot water on it (have a spoon or a spatula ready) 
                                and start mixing as soon as combined. As the dough cools down start mixing by hand, add flour if too sticky 
                                (don't overdo it, just enough to be able to mix by hand). It'll take at least 15 min. to mix well (if you have a mixer, 
                                it's recommended to use it). When it's become smooth and without bubbles place under plastic food foil for 10 minutes 
                                until the filling is prepared.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4>Filling:</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Wash the vegetables from all possible dirt. Finely chop cabbage, onion and corriander.</li>
                            <li>Mix minced mead with salt, pepper, soy sauce and Ginger. Add all of the vegetables. Mix well in a large bowl.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4>Forming:</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Take a large cutting board or a go to clean flat surface, cover it with flour.</li>
                            <li>Put a 1/3 of the dough on the surface (or as much as will fit when flattened). 
                                Roll it to a 1mm. thickness with a rolling pin (or anything that resembles it's form, like a vine bottle), 
                                if it sticks to the dough too much, apply more flour to the rolling pin.</li>
                            <li>Take a round glass and with the top end cut out dumpling forms.</li>
                            <li>With a dumpling form in one hand put a tablespoon of the filling inside, pinch the end of the dumplings together, while wettening
                                 the connecting parts with a little bit of water so they don't tear while coocking.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>
                        <h4>Cooking:</h4>
                        <p>The hard part is over, now it's time to take out the pan and heat it up with oil. When hot, insert the dumplings and 
                            turn them when one of the sides turn crispy and light brown. After turning a couple of times they're ready to take out.</p>
                        <h4>Note:</h4>
                        <p>Folding the dumplings might seem like a daunting task if never done before.
